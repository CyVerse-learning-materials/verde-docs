# Managing a Course in AI-VERDE

Once your course has been created, you’ll find it listed in your AI-VERDE dashboard.  From here, instructors can update course details, manage members, monitor usage, and design AI-powered learning activities.


## Course Overview
The **Overview tab** is your course’s home base.  
Here, you can:
- **Change the course name and description**  
  - Update the title to match your course
  - Add a clear description so students know the purpose.  
- **Set start and end dates**  
  - Determines when members can access course activities.  
  - Example: If you set a start date for Sept 1, students will not be able to log in before that date.  
- **Adjust course activity status**  
  - Switch a course to Active when ready for students.  
  - Change to Inactive If you want to temporarily pause access without deleting the course.  


## Managing Members
The **Members tab** gives you full control over who is enrolled and what they can do.  

Features:
- **Add new members**  
  - Enter the user’s email address.  
  - Assign them a role at the time of adding.  
- **Remove members**  
  - Select a user and remove them from the course.  
  - Useful if a student drops the class or a TA changes.  
- **Edit member roles**  
  - Roles determine what access each user has:  
    - **Instructor** → full course management rights.  
    - **TA** → supports course but with limited management tools.  
    - **Student** → participates in activities only.  

*Tip: If a student says they can’t see the course, check the Members tab first to make sure they are listed.*  


## Budget and Usage
AI-VERDE resources are tied to a budget, managed in coordination with the CyVerse team.  

- **Budgets are set by CyVerse**  
  - Instructors cannot adjust the total budget, but can request changes via support.  
- **What you can do as an instructor:**  
  - View **individual usage** → see how much each student has consumed.  
  - View **total course usage** → monitor whether the class is approaching budget limits.  
- **Why it matters:**  
  - Helps you plan assignments around available resources.  
  - Identifies students who may need guidance if their usage is unusually high.  



## AI Prompts and Content
The **Prompts feature** lets instructors design and share structured prompts for AI activities.  

How to use it:
1. Go to the Prompts tab.  
2. Write a prompt (e.g., “Summarize today’s lecture into 5 key points”).  
3. Sharing the prompt is automatic, members can generate AI responses inside Verde.  
4. Review outputs to ensure alignment with learning goals.  

*This feature helps standardize assignments and ensures all students are working from the same AI instructions.*  



## API Keys and Integrations
Instructors can extend Verde beyond the platform using API keys.  

- **Generate API keys**  
  - Useful for advanced workflows, automation, or integrating Verde with other systems.  
- **Export AI-VERDE outputs**  
  - Save or send results from Verde to external platforms (e.g., LMS, research tools, or data analysis environments).  
- **Why this matters:**  
  - Keeps Verde flexible, fitting into your department’s existing tools rather than operating as an isolated system.  


## Troubleshooting While Managing
- **Course doesn’t show up?** → Confirm with support that your course was created and check start date.  
- **A student can’t log in?** → Verify they are listed under Members. If not, add them.  
- **Budget concerns?** → Contact CyVerse to review or request an adjustment.  
- **Prompt not working as expected?** → Double-check formatting and reshare with the class.
