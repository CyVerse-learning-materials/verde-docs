#  Troubleshooting Guide

This guide covers the most common issues instructors face when getting started, creating a course, and managing a course in AI-VERDE.


## Getting Started Issues

- **Can’t find the API key after creating it**  
  - OpenAI only shows the key once. If you lost it, return to the [API Keys page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and generate a new one.  

- **Stache entry not accessible to the AI-VERDE team**  
  - Double-check you shared the entry with all required addresses:  
    - edwins@arizona.edu  
    - iychoi@arizona.edu  
    - zhxu73@arizona.edu  
 

## Creating a Course Issues

- **Form submitted but no confirmation**  
  - Wait up to 48 hours for processing.  
  - Check your spam/junk folder for CyVerse messages.  

- **CSV upload rejected**  
  - Ensure file format is `.CSV` (not `.XLSX`).  
  - Confirm there are no blank rows or invalid characters.  

- **Some students missing from initial roster**  
  - Double-check the CSV formatting.  
  - Resubmit the corrected file to **ai-verde-support@cyverse.org**.  

- **Course details are incorrect (name, description, or term)**  
  - Contact **ai-verde-support@cyverse.org** with the corrections.  


## Managing a Course Issues

- **Course doesn’t show up?** 
  - Confirm with support that your course was created and check start date.  
- **A student can’t log in?** 
  - Verify they are listed under Members. If not, add them.  

- **Budget seems off or not updating**  
  - Budgets are managed by CyVerse.  
  - Instructors can view usage but not set budgets — email support for adjustments.  

- **Students can’t access prompts**  
  - Ensure the prompt has been published/shared in the Prompts tab.  
  - Double-check course activity status is set to Active.  

- **Error generating API keys or exporting**  
  - Retry after refreshing your dashboard session.
