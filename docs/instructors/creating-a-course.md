# Creating a Course in AI-VERDE

Instructors do **not** create courses directly in AI-VERDE.  
Instead, courses are created by the CyVerse support team after you submit your course information.


## 1. Fill Out the Course Setup Form
- Complete the [Course Setup Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdkwrUP7uJSfUeWsl4a2jWQH_wA-bKLJbqIX0nNWLKNCMm5JQ/viewform).
- Provide details such as:   
  - Student names and emails  
  - Teaching assistants (TAs)  
  - Co-instructors  


## 2. Upload Your Course Roster
- Prepare a `.CSV` file with the following:  
  - Student names and emails  
  - Teaching assistants (TAs)  
  - Co-instructors  
-  Need a template? [Download the .CSV template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VgIASIX9rRSHWXp2O89PZSLf0sSaUz1y9MHUSMsoMzY/edit?gid=0#gid=0).  
  
Attach this file when submitting the form.  


## 3. What Happens Next
Once you submit the form:  
- **CyVerse staff** will create your course in AI-VERDE.  
- Students, TAs, and co-instructors from your CSV will be enrolled automatically.  
- Your course will appear in the **AI-VERDE dashboard** within **48 hours**.  



## 4. Troubleshooting
- **Course not showing up?** → Wait up to 48 hours. If still missing, email: ai-verde-support@cyverse.org.  
- **Roster errors?** → Double-check your CSV format and resubmit.  
- **Need to add or remove members after your course is created?** → You can manage enrollment changes after the course is created
