# Getting Started with OpenAI for Instructors

Welcome! If you are new to AI-VERDE, this guide will walk you through the essential first steps to get up and running.

Before you begin: please [Schedule Onboarding Session](https://outlook.office365.com/book/CyVerseAIVERDEOnboardingConsultation@emailarizona.onmicrosoft.com/?ae=true&login_hint&ismsaljsauthenabled=true) meeting with an AI-VERDE team coordinator.


## 1. Obtain an OpenAI Key
1. Log in to your [OpenAI account](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).  
2. Click **Create new secret key** to generate a new key.  
3. Copy the key and store it in a secure location.  


## 2. Create a Stache Entry to Share the OpenAI API Key
1. Log in to [stache.arizona.edu](https://stache.arizona.edu).  
2. Create a new **Stache entry** with the OpenAI API key.  
3. Share the entry with all of the following individuals:  
   - edwins@arizona.edu  
   - iychoi@arizona.edu  
   - zhxu73@arizona.edu  

## Troubleshooting

Having trouble getting started? Here are the most common issues instructors face:

- **Can’t find the API key after creating it** → OpenAI only shows the key once. If you lost it, go back to the [API Keys page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and create a new one.  

- **Stache entry not accessible to the AI-VERDE team** → Double-check that you shared the entry with all required addresses:  
    - edwins@arizona.edu  
    - iychoi@arizona.edu  
    - zhxu73@arizona.edu  

## Next Step: Gather Your Course Details  

Great work so far! Once your OpenAI key is shared, you’re ready to move on to the next stage: **Creating a course** to prepare your roster (students, TAs, and co-instructors) and submit it for course setup.
