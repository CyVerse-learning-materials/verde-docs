# Welcome!

## Introduction

Welcome to the AI-VERDE, an open source platform that facilitates access to commercial and on-premise LLMs with budget and access controls. AI-VERDE stands for "AI Virtual Explorer for Research, Discovery, and Education". There are two pieces to AI-VERDE, the AI-VERDE chat interface and the [AI-VERDE API](api/index.md) (application programming interface)

Our chat interface provides you with an interactive, AI-powered assistant designed to enhance your learning, research, and teaching experiences. Using cutting-edge language model technology from OpenAI, this interface allows you to engage with an advanced AI assistant capable of answering questions, offering explanations, and assisting with various tasks in real time.

## Key Features:

- **Interactive Q&A**: Simply type your question, and the assistant will provide clear, concise answers on a wide range of topics.
- **Designed for small teams and courses**: Use AI-VERDE for small teams, labs, and courses
- **Bring Your Own (BYO) LLM**: Instructors and team leads can optionally bring their own commercial or third-party LLM to AI-VERDE or use CyVerse's on-premise LLMs 
- **Built for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Instructors and team leads can optionally configure AI-VERDE to provide answers strictly from source documents
- **Budgets management and cost savings**: If you're using commercial services, tokens cost money. Use AI-VERDE to control model access, set budgets at the course or team, and to set budgets per individual.
- **Built-in Guardrails**: Ensure the responsible, safe, and effective use of AI-VERDE within your team and course
